# BO4E-dotnet
BO4E-dotnet is a C# implementation of **B**usiness **O**bjects for **E**nergy ([BO4E](https://www.bo4e.de/)), a standard use to model business objects in the German energy market. This repository contains class definitions and enumerations for most of the Business Objects. [JSON.net](https://github.com/JamesNK/Newtonsoft.Json) attributes are used to model obligatory and optional fields of the single business objects and components.

The source code in this repository is Open Source and avaiable under a MIT license; see [the license file](LICENSE).

## Nuget Packages and Usage of BO4E-dotnet
The content of this repository is used to build the following nuget packages:
- [Hochfrequenz.BO4Enet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Hochfrequenz.BO4Enet) contains definitions of the business objects (namespace `BO4E.BO`), compontents (namespace `BO4E.COM`) and enumerations (namespace `BO4E.ENUM`). This package depends on JSON.net only.
- [Hochfrequenz.BO4E.Extensions](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Hochfrequenz.BO4E.Extensions/) contains extension methods for business objects and components (currently Energiemenge and COM Verbrauch, which are heavily used by Hochfrequenz cloud solutions).
- [Hochfrequenz.BO4E.Reporting](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Hochfrequenz.BO4E.Extensions/) contains tools to analyse single business objects and sets of objects.
- [Hochfrequenz.BO4E.Extensions.Encryption](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Hochfrequenz.BO4E.Extensions.Encryption/) provides code to encrypt and anonymize Business Objects and compontents using [libsodium](https://libsodium.org)/[`Sodium`](https://github.com/tabrath/libsodium-core/) and [Bouncy Castle](https://bouncycastle.org/csharp/)/`Org.BouncyCastle` APIs.

## Getting Started
1. install the nuget package [Hochfrequenz.BO4Enet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Hochfrequenz.BO4Enet)
2. import it
```c#
using BO4E;
```
3. start developing applications based on Business Objects for Energy (BO4E).
```c#
using BO4E.BO;
using BO4E.COM;
using BO4E.ENUM;
...
var energiemenge = new Energiemenge()
{
    lokationsId = "DE0123456789012345678901234567890",
    lokationsTyp = LokationsTyp.MeLo,
    energieverbrauch = new List<Verbrauch>()
};
```

## Detailed Documentation
The docstrings from within the source code are used to generate a doc.fx based documentation which is available under TO BE SET UP. Please also consider the [official documentation](https://www.bo4e.de/dokumentation) maintained by Interessengemeinschaft Gesch√§ftsobjekte Energiewirtschaft e.V. from which most of the source code docstrings are copied/derived.
